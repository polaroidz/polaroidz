### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently looking for work 

🌱 And, I’m currently learning a lot about statistics, MATHS :heart:, data science and applied sciences. <!-- Also, pursuing my superior education in Math & Statistics at Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Brazil.  -->

💬 Ask me about:
- any of those topics and would love to chat with you :)
- I also love humanities, literature and poetry :neckbeard:. here is my [skoob profile](https://www.skoob.com.br/usuario/7672133-diegomrods) :smile:

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on social projects and open scientific research

🤔 I’m looking for help with starting a career in Data Science/Statistics but my CV is very focused in Software Development and Data Egineering at the moment. So, if you could help me with that would be amazing!
