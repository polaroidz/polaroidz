### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently looking for work 

🌱 And, I’m currently learning a lot about statistics, MATHS :heart:, data science and applied sciences. <!-- Also, pursuing my superior education in Math & Statistics at Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Brazil. -->

💬 Ask me about:
- any of those topics and would love to chat with you :)
- I also love humanities, literature and poetry :neckbeard:. here is my [skoob profile](https://www.skoob.com.br/usuario/7672133-diegomrods) :smile:

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on social projects and open scientific research

🤔 I’m looking for help with starting a career in Data Science or Statistics but my CV is very focused in Software Development and Data Egineering at the moment. So, if you could help me with that would be amazing!
