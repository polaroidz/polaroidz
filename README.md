### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for work 

ðŸŒ± And, Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about statistics, MATHS :heart:, data science and applied sciences. Also, pursuing my superior education in Math & Statistics at Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- any of those topics and would love to chat with you :)
- I also love humanities, literature and poetry :neckbeard:. here is my [skoob profile](https://www.skoob.com.br/usuario/7672133-diegomrods) :smile:

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on social projects and open scientific research

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with starting a career in Data Science/Statistics but my CV is very focused in Software Development and Data Egineering at the moment. So, if you could help me with that would be amazing!
